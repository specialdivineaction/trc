Contains data transfer objects for the different data types supported by the module. 
Data transfer objects are intended to be lightweight structs with publicly visible 
members. These are typically used for data transfer, for example, between the 
REST API implementation and the backend.

Data transfer objects should be easily serializable to JSON.
