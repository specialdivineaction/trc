This bundle is a legacy bundle to be migrated into the new TRC framework organization strategy.

Currently, it contains placeholder resources to be used as helpers and resources to support 
the development of TRC system services and entry type implementations. 

Note that the `edu.tamu.tcat.db.exec.sql.SqlExecutor` class is used by 
`ObservableTaskWrapper`. This probably should not be the case.
